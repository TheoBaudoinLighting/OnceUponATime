# OnceUponATime Language Specification

## üìñ Introduction
The **OnceUponATime (`.ouat`)** language is an innovative programming language designed for writing code through structured, narrative storytelling. This document details the syntax, grammar, and comprehensive rules required to craft valid `.ouat` programs.

---

## üìå Program Structure

Every `.ouat` program must strictly follow this narrative structure:
- **Prologue:** The program begins with the exact phrase `Once upon a time.`
- **Narrative Body:** Composed of structured sentences that represent program logic, each ending with a period.
- **Epilogue:** The program concludes explicitly with `The story ends.`

### **Example of a Valid .ouat Program**
```txt
Once upon a time.
Inside a castle of 100 meters, there was an ancient sword.
The ancient sword shone brightly under the moonlight.
The story ends.
```

## üìú Syntax Rules

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Header and Epilogue Rules**
- **Header (Prologue):** Every script must start with `Once upon a time.`
- **Footer (Epilogue):** Every script must end with `The story ends.`

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sentence Structure**
Each sentence must follow a clear subject-verb-object order to ensure precise parsing.

‚úÖ **Correct Examples:**
```txt
The knight rode the horse.
The dragon breathed fire.
```
‚ùå **Incorrect Examples:**
```txt
Horse rode knight the.
Fire breathed dragon.
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Object Declaration and Initialization**
Objects and characters must be declared explicitly:
```txt
There was a magical sword.
Inside the tower, there was a golden key.
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Properties and States**
Properties and states of objects must be clearly expressed:
```txt
The dragon was fierce and fiery.
The gate was locked.
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Control Flow**
Control structures manage program logic:
```txt
If the door is locked then
    display "The hero cannot pass."
else
    display "The hero opens the door."
endif.
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Loops and Iteration**
Loops follow a structured syntax:
```txt
While the dragon is awake
    display "The dragon breathes fire."
endwhile.

For each coin in the chest do
    display "The hero takes a coin."
endfor.
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Functions and Reusable Blocks**
Functions allow reusable narrative blocks:
```txt
Define the function healHero as
    display "The hero regains strength."
endfunction.

call invokeHealing.
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Interaction and Randomization**
Interactions with the user and randomness are clearly defined:
```txt
The hero choose "Which path should be taken?".
Random fate leans towards bravery or caution.
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Comments**
Comments provide context without affecting the execution:
- Begin with `Remark:`, `Note:`, or `Comment:`, and end with a period.

```txt
Remark: This introduces the main character's motives.
Note: Initialize health points here.
Comment: Descriptive section begins.
```

```

- **Improper structure**:
‚ùå Incorrect:

## üîç Future Extensions

- Support for dialogues (`"Greetings," said the knight.`)
